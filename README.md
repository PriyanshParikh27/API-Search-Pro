# Dynamic Data Search App

This application is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), initialized using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To launch the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the running application.

To customize the main page, edit the file located at `pages/index.js`. Any changes you make will automatically refresh in real-time.

For API functionality, check out the [API routes documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). The API routes are available at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello), and you can modify the code for this endpoint in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` folder maps directly to `/api/*`, transforming the contained files into [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) rather than standard React components.

This project leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for font optimization, seamlessly integrating and loading the Inter font from Google for a more refined user experience.
